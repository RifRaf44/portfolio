              I started playing around with HTML and CSS when I was a kid. Once
              I learned that all this could be manipulated using JS and backend
              programming I was hooked.
            </p>
            <p>
              Professionally, I have had the chance to work on several different
              projects using different technologies, always related to the web.
            </p>
            <p>
              Extending my knowledge to others, I have taught courses on
              HTML5/CSS3, javascript, Angular and Angular 2 using TypeScript.

              When you create something digital it's easy to get lost in the
              code and functionalities. Most software comes with a manual, but
              what if you didn't need one?
            </p>
            <p>
              I believe if a piece of software is well thought out and designed
              with the user's wishes in mind you can skip the manual and just
              use it straight out of the box. This isn't always an easy task and
              can only be achieved with the right mindset and approach.

              I started out making movies in the backyard with my friends.
              Creating lasting images is something that has inspired me and
