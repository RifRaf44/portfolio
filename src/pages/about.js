            I started playing around with HTML and CSS when I was a kid. Once I
            learned that all this could be manipulated using JS and backend
            programming I was hooked.

          <p>
            Professionally, I have had the chance to work on several different
            projects using different technologies, always related to the web.
          </p>
          <p>
            Extending my knowledge to others, I have taught courses on
            HTML5/CSS3, javascript, Angular and Angular 2 using TypeScript.

            I started out making movies in my backyard with my friends. Creating
            lasting images is something that has inspired me and still does to
            this day.
