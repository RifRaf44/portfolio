description: Redesigning and building the Kwaly website from the ground up using Gatsby, React and Netlify
---

This project was a challenge considering all these technologies were relatively new. I started out with a basic e-commerce template but rebuilt everything from the ground up. My friend [Eli](https://ecolpaert.com/) helped me along the way with some dev work, and also suggested I use tailwind so I took that into consideration while researching technologies. The site runs on the JAM stack powered by Netlify.
